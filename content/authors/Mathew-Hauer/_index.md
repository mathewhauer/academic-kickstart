Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Florida State University and a faculty affiliate in the Center for Demography and Population Health. My expertise is at the intersection of demography, migration, population projections, and climate change. My review article on [Sea Level Rise and Human Migration]( https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-019-0002-9) describes one of the most costly and permanent consequences of climate change.

This is an update.

I have received the [Cozzarelli Prize](http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/pnas-cozzarelli-2022.html) from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine for best paper in the Social and Behaviorial sciences published in the Proceedings of the National Academies, twice received the [E. Walter Terrie Award](https://www.sda-demography.org/Terrie-Award) for the best paper on Applied Demography, and the University of Georgia awarded me an [Excellence-in-Research Award](https://research.uga.edu/research-awards/award-recipients/graduate-student-excellence-in-research-award/) for my dissertation on sea level rise and human migration. More than 400 media outlets have covered my research including Time Magazine, the New York Times, the Guardian, the Washington Post, and National Geographic. My [publications](https://mathewhauer.com/publication/) appear in a diverse set of journals including *Nature Climate Change*, *Proceedings of the National Academies of Science*, *Demography*, *Environmental Research Letters*, *Demographic Research*, *Population and Environment*, *Statistical Modelling*, and *Population Research and Policy Review*, among others. Prior to arriving at FSU, I spent nearly a decade directing the Applied Demography Program at the University of Georgia.
