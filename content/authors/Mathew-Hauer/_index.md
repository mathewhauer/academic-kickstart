I am the Charles B. Nam Associate Professor of Sociology at Florida State University and a faculty affiliate in the Center for Demography and Population Health. My expertise is at the intersection of demography, migration, population projections, and climate change. 

I have received the [Cozzarelli Prize](http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/pnas-cozzarelli-2022.html) from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine for best paper in the Social and Behavioral sciences published in the Proceedings of the National Academies, the [Early Achievement Award](https://www.populationassociation.org/about/annual-awards/early-achievement-award#:~:text=The%20Early%20Achievement%20award%20recognizes,scholars%20who%20received%20their%20Ph.) from the Population Association of America, twice received the [E. Walter Terrie Award](https://www.sda-demography.org/Terrie-Award) for the best paper on Applied Demography, and the University of Georgia awarded me an [Excellence-in-Research Award](https://research.uga.edu/research-awards/award-recipients/graduate-student-excellence-in-research-award/) for my dissertation on sea level rise and human migration. More than 800 media outlets have covered my research including Time Magazine, the New York Times, the Guardian, the Washington Post, and National Geographic, amongst others. Prior to arriving at FSU, I spent nearly a decade directing the Applied Demography Program at the University of Georgia.

My dissertation work concerned forecasting the destinations of populations displaced by sea-level rise in the United States and has garnered more than 1,300 citations since 2016.
